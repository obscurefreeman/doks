近年来，中国城市加快发展，城市人居住环境得到显著改善。许多城市努力探索中国特色的城市高质量发展之路，城市功能不断完善，治理水平明显提高。中国持续开展城市生态修复和功能修补，全面实施城镇老旧小区改造，大力推进城市园林绿化，消除污染；同时大力推进城市基础设施体系化建设，开展房屋建筑和市政设施普查以及安全隐患排查整治，努力为市民创造高品质的生活环境，让城市更美丽、更安全、更宜居。

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In recent years, Chinese cities have accelerated their development, leading to significant improvements in urban living environments. Many cities are actively exploring a path of high-quality urban development with Chinese characteristics, continuously enhancing urban functions and significantly improving governance levels. China is carrying out ongoing efforts in urban ecological restoration and functional repairs, implementing comprehensive transformations of old residential neighborhoods in towns and cities, vigorously promoting urban landscaping and greenification to eliminate pollution. At the same time, there is a strong focus on the systematic construction of urban infrastructure, conducting surveys of housing construction and municipal facilities, as well as inspections and remediation of safety hazards. The aim is to create a high-quality living environment for citizens, making cities more beautiful, safer, and more livable.

近年来，越来越多的中国文化产品的走向全球市场，日益受到海外消费者的青睐。随着中国对外文化贸易的快速发展，中国文化产品出口额已持续多年位居世界前列，形成了一批具有国际影响力的文化企业产品的和品牌。数据显示，中国的出版物、影视作品、网络文学与动漫产品等在国外的销售量连年攀升。中国政府出台了一系列政策鼓励和支持更多具有中国元素的优秀文化产品的走出国门，扩大海外市场份额，进一步提升中国文化的世界影响力。

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In recent years, an increasing number of Chinese cultural products have been making their way into the global market and gaining popularity among overseas consumers. With the rapid development of China's foreign cultural trade, the export value of Chinese cultural products has consistently ranked among the top in the world, giving rise to a group of culturally influential enterprises and brands. Data shows that sales of Chinese publications, film and television productions, online literature, and animation products have been steadily increasing in foreign markets. The Chinese government has implemented a series of policies to encourage and support the international expansion of outstanding cultural products with Chinese elements, aiming to expand the overseas market share and further enhance the global influence of Chinese culture.

 

 



 

随着中国经济的快速发展和人们生活水平的稳步提高，城市居民对环境和生活品质的要求越来越高。中国地方政府更加注重公共设施的建设和改进，以更好地满足人们的需求。通过兴建新的广场、公园和公共绿地或对原有公共场地重新加以规划改造,许多城市为市民提供了更多休闲和社交的场所。如今,政府出资购置的健身器械和铺设的健身步道在不少城市随处可见，既明显改善了市民户外活动的条件,又使城市更加美丽。

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

With the rapid development of the Chinese economy and the steady improvement of people's living standards, urban residents have increasingly higher demands for the environment and quality of life. Local governments in China are paying more attention to the construction and improvement of public facilities to better meet people's needs. Many cities have provided citizens with more recreational and social spaces by constructing new squares, parks, and public green areas or by renovating existing public spaces. Nowadays, government-funded fitness equipment and the establishment of fitness trails can be seen everywhere in many cities, significantly improving outdoor activity conditions for citizens and making the cities more beautiful.

 

徐霞客是中国明代的著名地理学家。他花费了三十多年的时间游遍了大半个中国。他主要靠徒步跋涉,寻访了许多荒远偏僻的地区。他把自己的见闻和考察结果详细记录下来,为后人留下了珍贵的考察资料。他通过对许多河流的实地调查,纠正了文献中关于水源的错误。他还详细地描述了地形、气候等因素对植物的影响,生动地描绘了各地的名胜古迹和风土人情。他的考察记录由后人整理成了《徐霞客游记》,在国内外产生了广泛的影响。

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Xu Xiake was a renowned geographer in the Ming Dynasty of China. He spent over thirty years traveling across more than half of China. He primarily relied on walking and trekking, exploring many remote and desolate regions. He meticulously recorded his observations and research findings, leaving behind valuable materials for future generations. Through field investigations of numerous rivers, he corrected errors in existing literature regarding water sources. He also provided detailed descriptions of the impact of terrain, climate, and other factors on plants, vividly depicting the scenic spots, historical sites, and local customs of various regions. His travel records were later compiled by others into the book "*Xu Xiake's Travel Notes,*" which has had a profound influence domestically and internationally.

Zheng He is the most outstanding navigator in Chinese history, showcasing exceptional wisdom and remarkable talent in various fields such as navigation, diplomacy, and military affairs. He led seven expeditions with enormous fleets, visiting many countries and regions in the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean, deepening mutual understanding between China and Southeast Asia, and East Africa. Zheng He's voyages to the Western Seas played a significant role in promoting economic and cultural exchanges between China and foreign nations, as well as making enormous contributions to regional peace. To forever commemorate Zheng He and his remarkable achievements, July 11, the day he set sail for his first expedition, has been designated as China's Maritime Day.



 

张骞(Zhang Qian)是中国第一个伟大的探险家。他不畏艰险,克服重重困难,两次出使西域,开通了中国同西亚和欧洲的通商关系,将中国的丝和丝织品运往西亚和欧洲,开拓了历史上著名的“丝绸之路”。同时,他又将西域的风土人情、地理文化以及特有物种等介绍到中原,极大地开阔了人们的视野。正如历史学家所指出的那样,如果没有张骞出使西域,就不可能有丝绸之路的开辟,也就不会有汉朝同西域或欧洲的文化交流。

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Zhang Qian was the first great explorer in China. Fearless and resilient, he overcame numerous hardships and embarked on two missions to the Western Regions, establishing trade relations between China, West Asia, and Europe. He facilitated the transportation of Chinese silk and silk products to West Asia and Europe, thereby pioneering the famous "Silk Road" in history. Additionally, he introduced the customs, geography, culture, and unique species of the Western Regions to the Central Plains, greatly broadening people's horizons. As historians have pointed out, without Zhang Qian's expeditions to the Western Regions, the opening of the Silk Road would not have been possible, and there would have been no cultural exchanges between the Han Dynasty and the Western Regions or Europe.

自古以来,印章在中国就是身份的凭证和权力的象征。印章不仅具有实用性,而且也是一种艺术形式,是一门集书法与雕刻于一体的古老艺术,经常被看作与书画并列的独立艺术品。印章从材料的选择、制作的工艺到字体的设计,都具有极其丰富的美学表现。其他国家的艺术家通常在其绘画作品上签名,而中国艺术家则往往在其书画作品上盖上印章代替签名。这样,印章也就成为作品的组成部分,是体现作品独特性的一种方式。

Since ancient times, the seal has been a certificate of identity and a symbol of power in China. Seal is not only practical, but also an art form. It is an ancient art integrating calligraphy and carving, and is often regarded as an independent art alongside calligraphy and painting. From the selection of materials, the craft of making to the design of fonts, the seal has extremely rich aesthetic expression. Artists from other countries usually sign their paintings, while Chinese artists often affix their seals instead of signatures on their paintings and calligraphy. In this way, the seal becomes an integral part of the work and is a way to reflect the uniqueness of the work.
