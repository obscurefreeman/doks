Text1 ：

In recent years, the food industry has increased its use of labels. Whether the labels say 'non-GMO (非转基因的), or "no sugar,' or 'zero carbohydrates', consumers are increasingly demanding more information about what's in their food. One report found that 39 percent of consumers would switch from the brands they currently buy to others that provide clearer, more accurate product information. Food manufacturers are responding to the report with new labels to meet that demand, and they're doing so with an eye towards giving their products an advantage over the competition, and bolstering profits.

This strategy makes intuitive sense. If consumers say they want transparency, tell them exactly what is in your product. That is simply supplying a certain demand. But the marketing strategy in response to this consumer demand has gone beyond articulating what is in a product, to labeling what is NOT in the food. These labels are known as "absence claims" labels, and they represent an emerging labeling trend that is detrimental both to the consumers who purchase the products and the industry that supplies them.

For example, Hunt's put a "non-GMO" label on its canned crushed tomatoes a few years ago-despite the fact that at the time there was no such thing as a GMO tomato on the market. Some dairy companies are using the "non-GMO" label on their milk, despite the fact that all milk is naturally GMO-free, another label that creates unnecessary fear around food.

While creating labels that play on consumer fears and misconceptions about their food may give a company a temporary marketing advantage over competing products on the grocery aisle, in the long term this strategy will have just the opposite effect: by injecting fear into the discourse about our food, we run the risk of eroding consumer trust in not just a single product, but the entire food business. 

Eventually, it becomes a question in consumers' minds: Were these foods ever safe? By purchasing and consuming these types of products, have I already done some kind of harm to my family or the planet?For food manufacturers, it will mean damaged consumer trust and lower sales for everyone. And this isn't just supposition. A recent study found that absence claims labels can create a stigma around foods even when there is no scientific evidence that they cause harm.

It's clear that food manufacturers must tread carefully when it comes to using absence claims. In addition to the likely negative long-term impact on sales, this verbal trick sends a message that innovations in farming and food processing are unwelcome, eventually leading to less efficiency, fewer choices for consumers, and ultimately, more costly food products. If we allow this kind of labeling to continue, we will all lose.

Text 2 The trend toward rationality and enlightenment was endangered long before the advent of the World Wide Web. As Neil Postman noted in his 1985 book Amusing Ourselves to Death, the rise of television introduced not just a new medium but a new discourse; a gradual shift from a typographic (印刷的) culture to a photographic one, which in turn meant a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment. In an image-centered and pleasure-driven world, Postman noted, there is no place for rational thinking, because you simply cannot think with images. It is text that enables us to "uncover lies, confusions and overgeneralizations, and to detect abuses of logic and common sense. It also means to weigh ideas, to compare and contrast assertions, to connect one generalization to another."

The dominance of television was not confined to our living rooms. It overturned all of those habits of mind, fundamentally changing our experience of the world, affecting the conduct of politics, religion, business, and culture. It reduced many aspects of modern life to entertainment, sensationalism, and commerce. "Americans don't talk to each other, we entertain each other," Postman wrote. "They don't exchange ideas, they exchange images. They do not argue with propositions, they argue with good looks,celebrities and commercials."

At first, the web seemed to push against this trend. When it emerged towards the end of the 1980s as a purely text-based medium, it was seen as a tool to pursue knowledge, not pleasure. Reason and thought were most valued in this garden—all derived from the project of the Enlightenment. Universities around the world were among the first to connect to this new medium, which hosted discussion groups, informative personal or group blogs, electronic magazines, and academic mailing lists and forums. It was an intellectual project, not about commerce or control, created in a scientific research center in Switzerland. And for more than a decade, the web created an alternative space that threatened television's grip on society.

Social networks, though, have since colonized the web for television's values. From Facebook to Instagram, the medium refocuses our attention on videos and images, rewarding emotional appeals— "like' buttons over rational ones. Instead of a quest for knowledge, it engages us in an endless zest (热 情) for instant approval from an audience, for which we are constantly but unconsciously performing.(It's telling that, while Google began life as a PhD thesis, Facebook started as a tool to judge classmates' appearances.) It reduces our curiosity by showing us exactly what we already want and think, based on our profiles and preferences. The Enlightenment's motto (座右铭) of 'Dare to know' has become "Dare not to care to know.'

Text 3 According to a recent study, a small but growing proportion of the workforce is affected to some degree by a sense of entitlement. Work is less about what they can contribute but more about what they can take. It can lead to workplace dysfunction and diminish their own job satisfaction. I'm not referring to employees who are legitimately dissatisfied with their employment conditions due to, say, being denied fair pay or flexible work practices. I'm talking about those who consistently believe they deserve special treatment and generous rewards. It's an expectation that exists irrespective of their abilities or levels of performance.

As a result of that diserepancy between the privileges they feel they're owed and their inflated sense of self-worth, they don't work as hard for their employer. They prefer instead to slack off. It's a tendency which many scholars believe begins in childhood due to parents who overindulge their kids. This thereby leads them to expect the same kind of spoilt treatment throughout their adult lives. And yet despite how these employees feel, it's obviously important for their manager to nonetheless find out how to keep them motivated. And, by virtue of that heightened motivation, to perform well.

The research team from several American universities surveyed more than 240 individuals. They sampled managers as well as team members. Employee entitlement was measured by statements such as "I honestly feel I'm just more deserving than others." The respondents had to rate the extent of their agreement. Employee engagement, meanwhile, was assessed with statements like "I really throw myself into my work." The findings revealed ethical leadership is precisely what alleviates the negative effects of employee entitlement. That's because rather than indulging employees or neglecting them, ethical leaders communicate very direct and clear expectations. They also hold employees accountable for their behaviors and are genuinely committed to doing the right thing. Additionally, these leaders are consistent in their standards. They're also less likely to deviate in how they treat employees.

This means, when confronted by an entitled team member, an ethical leader is significantly disinclined to accommodate their demands. He or she will instead point out, constructively and tactfully, exactly how their inflated sense of deservingness is somewhat distorted. They'd then go further to explain he specific, and objective, criteria the employee must meet to receive their desired rewards. This shift way from unrealistic expectations is successful because entitled employees feel more confident that ethical leaders will deliver on their promises. This occurs because they're perceived to be fair and trustworthy.The researchers, however, exercise caution by warning no one single response is the perfect remedy. But there's no denying ethical leadership is at least a critical step in the right direction.

Text 4 : The subject of automation and its role in our economy has taken hold in American publie discourse.Technology broadly and automation specifically are dramatically reshaping the way we work. And we need to have a plan for what's still to come.

We don't have to look further than our own communities to see the devastating impact of automation.From automated warehouses to cashierless grocery stores to neighborhood libraries that offer self-cheekout lanes instead of employing real people—automation is increasingly replacing jobs and leaving too few good new jobs behind.

The statistics in manufacturing are staggering. Despite the widespread fears about trade, a recent report showed that just 13 percent of jobs lost in manufacturing are due to trade-the rest of the losses have been due to advances in technology.

That is why more people are criticizing the ever-increasing role of technology in our economy. Our country is manufacturing more than ever before, but we are doing it with fewer workers. However, it's not just factories that are seeing losses-software and information technology are also having a dramatie impact on jobs most people think are secure from the forces of a rapidly-changing economy. Something transformative is happening in America that is having an adverse effect on American families. Whether policymakers and politicians admit it or not, workers have made clear their feelings about their economie insecurity and desire to keep good jobs in America.

So why are people so insistent on ignoring the perils of automation? They are failing to look ahead at a time when planning for the future is more important than ever. Resisting automation is futile; it is as inevitable as industrialization was before it. I sincerely hope that those who assert that automation will make us more effective and pave the way for new occupations are right, but the reality of automation's detrimental effects on workers makes me skeptical. No one can currently say where the new jobs are coming from or when, and any sensible company or country should prepare for all alternatives.

I'm not overstating the danger: look at what's happened to the labor force. According to economic research, one in six working-age men, 25-54, doesn't have a job. Fifty years ago, nearly 100 percent of men that age were working. Women's labor force participation, meanwhile, has slipped back to the level it was at in the late 1980s.

American families and prominent business leaders are aware that there's a big problem with automation. The value of a college degree is diminishing, and our upward mobility is declining. If we want an economy that allows everyone to be economically secure, we need to start thinking about how we can rightfully address automation.

Text 5 Look at the people around you. Some are passive, others more aggressive. Some work best alone, others crave companionship. We easily recognize that there is great variation among the individuals who live near us. Yet, when we speak of people from elsewhere, we seem to inevitably characterize them based on their country of origin.

Statistics specialists, when they speak of national averages, often make the same mistake.

Newly published research shows how erroneous such overviews are. Three researchers analyzed decades of values-based surveys and found that only between 16% and 21% of the variation in cultural values could be explained by differences between countries. In other words, the vast majority of what makes us culturally distinct from one another has nothing to do with our homeland.

To determine what factors really are associated with culture, the authors combined data from 558 prior surveys that each measured one or more of Hofstede's cultural dimensions. These are traits, such as individualism and masculinity, that describe work-related cultural values. (They are not a measure of visible cultural traits, such as food or dress.) Though the validity of Hofstede's dimensions has been questioned, they have the singular benefit of having been in use for decades, which allows for historical and international comparisons.

The researchers found that both demographic factors, such as age, and environmental factors, such as long-term unemployment rates, were more correlated with cultural values than nationality. Occupation and social economic status were the most strongly correlated, suggesting that our values are more economically driven than we usually give them credit for.

The evidence implies that people with similar jobs and incomes are more culturally alike, regardless of where they live. Vas Taras, the lead author of the study, puts it this way: "Tell me how much you make and I will make a pretty accurate prediction about your cultural values. Tell me what your nationality is and I probably will make a wrong prediction."

Taras says our erroneous belief that countries are cultures has caused businesses to teach their employees useless or even harmful ways of interacting with their international peers. Chinese and American lawyers might be trained to interact based on the assumption that the Chinese person is less individualistic, even though their similar social economic situations make it probable they are actually quite alike in that regard.

The country, as the unit of authority, is often a convenient way of generalizing about a population.However, our focus on countries can mask broad variations within them. In the majority of cases we would be better off identifying people by the factors that constrain their lives, like income, rather than by the lines surrounding them on a map.

Text 6 Selective colleges and universities in the U.S. are under fire for being too elite and too expensive, and for not training graduates for the world of work. Such charges ignore the fact that these institutions continue to prepare students for success in their work, for thoughtful engagement in civic life, for lifelong learning, and for understanding the world and those with whom they live.

These colleges and universities must be doing something right. Applications are at record highs, and their financial aid programs make them more accessible than ever. This model of education has long played a central role in creating opportunity, driving economic growth, and spurring innovation.

Yet, there is growing skepticism about the value of this model. The recent tax reform bill is a wake-up call that our strongest colleges and universities are under assault by some in government. The initial proposals would have made education unaffordable for many by taxing tuition waivers for graduate students and ending deductions for student loan interest.Thankfully, these provisions were ultimately stripped from the bill, but lawmakers let stand a new tax on the investment income of some colleges and universities.

While these attacks are motivated by misguided ideas, we need to do a better job of explaining why these claims are false and why what we do is valuable. We cannot take for granted that any of this is obvious.

It is often said that elite colleges and universities do not train students, particularly those who study the liheral arts, for the workforce. But this can he refuted hy scholarly research. The data are clear: a liberal arts education is great career preparation, both for excellent lifetime earnings and for satisfaction with the work. This education develops the skills of critical thinking, rigorous analysis of data and facts, communication with the written and spoken word, understanding of cultural differences and issues, and the ability to keep learning. In fact, liberal arts graduates do extremely well in every imaginable field.

Access to an education at selective colleges and universities is now more available than ever to low-and middle-income families. We have built endowments from donations by alumni (校友) and parents who understand and appreciate our mission to provide access and opportunity, and a significant portion of the returns from these endowments is used to fund financial aid.

Ironically, the new tax on endowments drains financial aid funds from the very schools most able to offer opportunity to those who have earned a spot but cannot otherwise afford this education. Beyond the virtue of access to those who have earned a place at these schools, the diversity of economic backgrounds enhances the education and experience ofall of our students.





46.What fact does the author emphasize concerning selective colleges and universities?

A) They have been ignoring the training of graduates for the world of work.

B) They have been doing well in ensuring their students a successful future.

C) They have been constantly attacked for being too elite and too expensive.

D) They have been actively engaged in civic life beyond the school campus.

 

47.What does the author say in arguing for the model of education in the U.S.?

A) It has contributed substantially to the nation's overall development.

B) It has succeeded in maintaining sustainable financial aid programs 

C) It has given priority to innovative programs for graduate studies.

D) It has played a central role in attracting international applicants.

 

 

\48. What do we learn about the initial proposals concerning the recent tax reform bill?

A) They would have stripped many students of life's chances.

B) They would have deducted graduate student loan interest.

C) They would have added to many students' financial burden.

D) They would have increased the number of tuition waivers.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49.What do the data show about elite colleges and universities?

A) Their graduates lack the rigor required for doing statistical analysis.

B) Their students prove to be inadequately prepared for their future careers.

C) Their focus on research is conducive to developing students' critical thinking.

D) Their liberal arts education enables graduates to excel in whatever field they are in.

 

50.What is an advantage of providing financial aid for students?

A) Every student can choose the institution they wish to attend.

B) All students can benefit from a diversified student population.

C) All students will be able to earn a place on university campus.

D) Less privileged students will be more competitive at elite schools.

# TEXT60



Text 7 When a group of Australians was asked why they believed climate change was not happening, about 36% said it was "common sense", according to a report published last year by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. This was the most popular reason for their opinion, with only 11% saying their belief that climate change was not happening was based on scientific research.

But what do we mean by an appeal to common sense? Presumably it's an appeal to rationality of some sort that forms the basis of more complex reasoning. The appeal to common sense, however, is usually nothing more than an appeal to thinking that just feels right, but what feels right to one person may not feel right to another. Whether it feels right is usually a reflection of the world view and ideologies we have internalised, and that frames how we interact with new ideas. When new ideas are in accord with what we already believe, they are more reacily accepted. When they are not, they, and the arguments that lead to them, are more readily rejected.

We often mistake this automatic compatibility testing of new ideas with existing beliefs as an application of common sense, but, in reality, it is more about judging than thinking.As Nobelist Daniel Kahneman rotes in Thinking, Fast and Slow, when we arrive at conclusions in this way, the outcomes also feel true, regardless of whether they are. We are not psychologically well equipped to judge our own thinking.

We are also highly susceptible to a range of cognitive biases such as giving preference to the first things that come to mind when making decisions or giving weight to evidence.

One way we can check our internal biases and inconsistencies is through the social verification of knowledge, in which we test our ideas in a rigorous and systematic way to see if they make sense not just to us, but to other people. The outstanding example of this socially shared cognition is science.

That does not mean that individuals are not capable of excellent thinking, nor does it mean no individual is rational. But the extent to which individuals can do this on their own is a function of how well integrated they are with communities of systematic inquiry in the first place. You can't learn to think well by yourself.

In matters of science at least, those who value their common sense over methodological, collaborative investigation imagine themselves to be more free in their thinking, unbound by involvement with the group, but in reality they are tightly bound by their capabilities and perspectives. We are smarter together than we are individually, and perhaps that's just common sense.



51.What does the author intend to show by citing the findings from the report published last year?

A) People seldom appeal to rationality in their thinking.

B) It is often the case that truth lies in the hands of a few.

C) Common sense and science are the two sides of a coin.

D) Few people know if climate change is really happening.

 

52.What is the appeal to common sense according to the author?

A) It is the basis for the internalisation of individuals' ideologies.

B) It is a series of conceptions formulated from complex reasoning.

C) It is collective wisdom that helps people interact with new ideas.

D) It is something subjective based on what one perceives to be right.

 

53.What does Daniel Kahneman think is the problem of testing new ideas with existing beliefs?

A) It may lead to incorrect judgment.

B) It makes no use of common sense.

C) It fails to correct mistakes through serious reasoning.

D) It can produce psychologically unacceptable outcomes.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54.What can we do to be less susceptible to cognitive biases?

A) Give equal weight to evidence of both sides in a conflict.

B) Provide convincing examples in developing an argument.

C) Establish socially shared cognition via scientific methods.

D) Avoid inconsistencies when addressing controversial issues.

 

55.What message does the author try to convey at the end of the passage?

A) Multiple perspectives stimulate people's interest in exploring the unknown.

B) Individuals can enhance their overall capabilities by interacting with others.

C) Individuals should think freely to break from the restrictions of common sense.

D) Collaborative efforts can overcome individuals limitations in scientific inquiry.

Text 8 Since American idol star Taryn Southern started composing music with Al in 2017, musicians all over the world have begun wondering about the implications of Al and modern technology where music production is concerned. Using Al in the creation of music is perceived by some as a helpful tool and by others as almost "the beginning of the end".

In Taryn's case, AI software enabled her to communicate melodies and chords that shel didn't know how to put together herself. The end product was therefore a collaborative effort, rather than a piece entirely produced by technology. Taryn's story has a distinctly positive feel that highlights the advantages of using Al in music production. It can serve as a source of inspiration, and as an ideal jumping-off point should a musician be hit withwriter's block (文思枯竭).

Contrary to seeing AI as a tocl, some musicians consider it to be hugely detrimental to the music scene. At the moment, because such technology is still so young, the music it's producing is not necessarily what we want to hear. In short, it's not of great quality. Those who have produced their own music, or even fans of authentic, artistic music, will also argue that a computer could never emulate the work (and human touch) of a true musician.

Music has been an integral part of the story of humans for ages; in fact, the first known piece of music is believed to be around 3,400 years old. Songs have long been used as a means of communicating messages and folk stories, covering everything from societal ethics to world history. Since many people see music as such an inherently human expression, it is often considered as too precious to impart to technology. The thought of a computer generating a "random" piece of music that hasn't been painstakingly created by an artist is almost seen as sacrilegious (亵渎神圣的).

Regardless of which side of the argument you fall on, it seems likely that the use of Al in music production will only become more frequent. Our modern world is preoccupied with technological advancements. Instead of shying away from the idea of this bleak future, the best approach to take is one of optimism and curiosity. While there are always bound to be stubborn old-school musicians who refuse to use tech, music producers should consider Al as something to be embraced. AI music software is still very much in its infancy, but with more investors interested in the development and outcomes of such technology, and considering the rapid growth rate of other tech advances in recent years, it's only a matterof time before Al-produced music is seen as the new norm.

# TEXT62



Text 9 A few weeks ago, a well-meaning professor tried to explain the physiological process behind viruses and the human body in a tweet and was immediately criticized for a mistake in his information. He then issued an apology and deleted his erroneous tweet.

Communicating science beyond the academic bubble is necessary to augmenting public understanding of health and environmental issues and helping individuals make well-informed personal decisions.

However, scientists who engage in science communication must acknowledge that even in their area, their expertise is deep but narrow. They need to recognize the constraints in their own knowledge. That is not to suggest that they only write or present on their own research, but rather, that they consult with an expert if the topic is outside of their discipline Fact-checking with a scientist who works in the specialty will prevent the unintentional spread of misinformation, and the process of doing so may yield tiny pieces of interesting new information that can be incorporated.

Some have argued that the public is not educated enough to understand scientific information, especially for any complex phenomena, but this is absurd. Science instruction can be found at all levels of public education with most secondary schools offering classes on biology, physics, and chemistry. If anything, social media has shown that the public craves knowledge based on a solid scientific foundation. Even the public discourse that follows most scientific articles shows that online readers can understand even the most baffling of scientific principles.

It is equally imperative to emphasize that being an expert on a topic does not automatically make a scholar qualified to communicate it to a nonscientific audierce. A number of scientists recently have been offering public-aimed explanations of scientific phenomena. Even though they have appropriate credentials, they often do very little in the way of explaining. One biologist shared an intricate analogy involving a library, books, paper, a recipe, ingredients, and a cake to explain the process behind vaccines. Any explanation that requires a written key to keep track of what each item represents is not a clear example for public consumption.

Science communication is a science in and of itself. It requires rigorous training and instruction. A scientist should take communication courses that can teach a person how to identify and eliminate jargon and how to develop effective analogies to explain complex concepts. One cannot assume communication expertise-imagine if someone just decided that they were a physicist and started trying to contribute to the field without the necessary background. Doing a poor job communicating science to the public will only create confusion and widen the gap between science and society, a gap that scientists are trying toclose.



\51. What does the author say about communicating science to the general public?

A) It will help them to keep abreast of the latest scientific developments.

B) It is a necessary means to improve their understanding of scientific issues.

C) It will get them more involved in academic debates on environmental problems, 

D) It is an effective way to augment scientists' influence beyond the academic circle.

 

\52. What does the author advise scientists do to deal with topics outside of their specialty?

A) Write or present on them from new angles.

B) Utilize information from diverse sources.

C) Turn to a specialist for professional help.

D) Fact-check with colleagues in their field.

 

53.What does the author say we can learn from social media?

A) A solid academic foundation is essential to understanding baffling scientific principles.

B) Modern technology has facilitated communication between scientists and the public. 

C) Scientific articles have gained increasing popularity among the general public.

D) The public's understanding of science is much better than some have claimed.

 

 

 

 

\54. What does the example of the biologist who shared an intricate analogy show?

A) It is helpful to use illustrations in explaining scientific phenomena.

B) It is imperative to have appropriate titles to explain scientific issues.

C) A learned scholar is not necessarily a qualified science communicator.

D) A nonscientific audience cannot duly understand principles of science.

 

 

\55. What does the author suggest scientists do to close the gap between science and society?

A) Explain complex concepts scientifically

B) Make appropriate use of scientific terms.

C) Take courses in public speaking. 

D)Develop communication skills.

Text 10 The U.S. and China don't agree on much these days. Germany and France share a border and a currency but are frequently at odds. The U.K. and India like to march to their own drum. But there's one issue on which all these countries see eye to eye: Technology companies are too big, too powerful, and too profitable. And that power is only likely to intensify, leaving governments with no choice but to confront it head-on by taking the companies to court, passing new competition laws, and perhaps even breaking up the tech giants.

China is the latest to implement an anti-trust crackdown, unveiling anti-monopoly rules last month.The draft rules followed the surprise suspension of a $ 37 billion stock offering by billionaire Jack Ma'sAnt Group Co., making clear that no company can evade the government's regulation. The moves inChina coincide with accelerating efforts in the U. S. and Europe to rein in Amazon.com, Apple,Facebook, and Google.

"The big get bigger and bigger but without being better," says Andreas Schwab, a German member of the European Parliament who championed a 2014 resolution to break up Google. "Growing economic power, growing influence on local markets all over the world, and a growing concern of competitors and consumers altogether have made it happen now."

In this new anti-trust era, the old focus on pricing power no longer applies, because several of the biggest tech companies have established trillion-dollar monopolies by charging consumers next to nothing.Tech giants are inereasingly assuming powerful positions in banking, finance, advertising, retail, and other markets that force smaller businesses to rely on their platforms to reach customers.

For years, Europe alone confronted the power of digital giants. Governments were alarmed that European companies were failing to match Silicon Valley's innovations or to stop Google and Facebook from vacuuming up personal data and, with that, advertising revenue. Led by Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's competition chief, countries have sought to police the market and encourage fair play.

In China the crackdown has been driven at least partly by fear that the homegrown tech industry is becoming too powerful. The country has long championed Alibaba and Tencent, but their massive accumulation of data on the Chinese citizenry is a growing concern for Beijing.

In the U.S., a new breed of anti-trust experts argues that consideration should be given to privacy, control over data, workers' rights, and the overall impact on smaller companies. And the public in general have grown increasingly skeptical of social media companies. More than 60% say the sector has a negative effect on the country, and almost half want more regulation for social media, according to a 2020 Pew Research Center study.

 



46.What does the author say is the issue all major economic powers have to address?

B) They are frequently denied access to tech giants' platforms.

C) They have to change marketing strategies to keep customers.

D) They no longer have the power to price their own products.

A) They have imposed strict regulation over digital giants' advertising.

B) They have considered regulatory action to promote fair competition.

Text 11 Born from the accessibility of mass air travel, modern international tourism has been popularized as "holiday-making" in regions that offer comparative advantages of sand, sun and sea. Travel is often portrayed as a tool for personal growth and tourism as an economie motor for destination countries and cities. There is a tendency to assume that tourism is good for everyone involved.

Today the big bang of tourism drives over 1.2 billion tourists across international borders annually.Many popular places are literally being loved to death. Recent protests in ports of call like Venice and Barcelona against disturbances created by cruise ships show the unfortunate consequences of emphasizing quantity over quality in tourism.

Uncontrolled tourism development has become a primary driver of social and environmental disruption. Tourism studies provide much documentation of the many negative social impacts of tourism and resulting resentment that local populations direct toward visitors.

Antagonism toward tourists typically develops in mature, heavily visited destinations. Protests in heavily visited destinations suggest that traditional tourism has overstayed its welcome.

Residents often become frustrated when the benefits of tourism are not felt locally. Although it can generate foreign exchange, income and employment, there's no guarantee that multinational hotel chains will allocate these benefits equitably among local communities.

On the contrary, when people stay at large resorts or on cruise ships, they make most of their purchases there, leaving local communities little opportunity to benefit from tourist spending. These forms of tourism widen economic and political gaps between haves and have-nots at local destinations.

In recent decades, local residents in destination communities also have found themselves negotiating new cultural boundaries, class dynamics, service industry roles and lifestyle transformations. For example, data show that tourism activity corresponds to increased social problems as local residents adopt the behaviors of tourists.

What does all this mean for the everyday traveler?

First, all tourists should make every effort to honor their hosts and respect local conditions. This means being prepared to adapt to local customs and norms, rather than expecting local conditions to adapt to travelers.

Second, tourism is a market-based activity and works best when consumers reward better performers.In the information age, there's little excuse for travelers being uninformed about where their vacation money goes and who it enriches.

Informed travelers also are better able to distinguish between multinational companies and local entrepreneurs whose businesses provide direct social, environmental, and economic benefits for local residents. Such businesses are in love with the destination and are therefore deserving of market reward.In the long run, being a responsible traveler means ensuring net positive impacts for local people and environments. With the information available at our fingertips, there has never been more opportunity to do so.



51.What is the popular assumption about international tourism?

A) Its benefits may compensate for the adverse environmental consequences.

B) Its rapid development is attributed to people's improved living standard.

C) It appeals to people in places with favorable geographical conditions.

D) It contributes to the economy of destination countries and regions.

53.Why does the author say local residents of popular destinations often feel frustrated?

A) They fall victim to social conflicts and environmental disturbances.

B) They have little opportunity to enjoy themselves on cruise ships.

C) They cannot find employment in multinational hotel chains.

D) They do not think they benefit as much as they deserve.

 

54.How does the author say local residents in destination communities respond to tourism activity?

A) They endeavor to adapt to it.

B) They readily adopt new lifestyles.

C) They immerse tourists in their culture.

D) They try to upgrade their business models.

 

55.What can tourists do to exert more positive impacts on the tourist destinations?

B) Seek possibilities to invest in local companies.

C) Use the services provided by local businesses 

D) Give favorable comments about their services.

Text 12 Many people associate their self-worth with their work. The more successful their career, the better they feel about themselves. Work-related self-esteem is therefore a worthy ideal to pursue with vigor, right? Well, not always. According to recent research, in which psychologists interviewed 370 full-time workers over a period of three weeks, the reality is a little more complicated. And it involves negative as well as positive consequences.

It's natural to be drawn towards pleasure and to step away from pain. In the workplace, if that pleasure comes from a triumph which swells our self-respect, people will try to repeat the accomplishment. But repeating that accomplishment is often not realistic, which can lead to severe negative emotional consequences when it doesn't reoccur. This form of motivation is widely regarded as a negative type of motivation. It can hinder other more positive motivation types, such as completing a task purely because it's fulfilling or enjoyable.

What consumes the employee instead is a pressing need to feel mighty and sure of themselves. They then take on only tasks and objectives which serve that ego-driven need. As a result, to avoid feelings of shame and worthlessness associated with failure, they extend themselves to such a degree that there's a subsequent adverse effect on their well-being. This internal pressure to succeed at all costs demands a lot of effort. It depletes their energy, culminating in disproportionate levels of damaging sentiment.

Those negative emotions mount into heightened anxiety, impacting their ability to make the most of their personal life. Their desire to avoid feeling inferior ends up making them feel inferior when it comes to their diminished capacity for friendship and leisure. They end up dissatisfied both at work and outsideof it.

But thankfully, for those people compelled almost entirely by this specific form of motivation, the news isn't all bad, or bad at all. The study also discovered several positive outcomes that can actually outweigh the harmful ones. Though these types of employees are motivated by the desire to avoid negative consequences, they are also motivated by the excitement of pursuing emotional rewards. This excitement makes pursuing goals enjoyable and stimulates pleasure and pride that would result from success. An effcet of the positive motivation is that it neutralizes the existence of negative motivation.

Sure, it affects people's personal lives to what could be deemed an unhealthy extent, because leisure activities are often seen as a part of life that must be sacrificed to manage work and family demands.However, the way people feel about their work has less to do with whether they're motivated by the preservation of self-esteem but more with the fact that they're simply motivated.

Text 13 Degradation of the world's natural resources by humans is rapidly outpacing the planet's ability to absorb the damage, a recent UN environmental study has found. The study concludes that without radical action the level of prosperity that millions of people in the developed world count on will be impossible to maintain or extend to poorer countries.

Water scarcity is the curse of some of the poorest regions on Earth, leaving developing countries increasingly unable to feed themselves, and causing hardship for millions of people. There appears little prospect of this desperate situation being remedied without radical action being taken. Water resources are under increasing threat from population growth, climate change, rapid urbanization, rising levels of consumption, and the degradation of lands that previously provided a natural replenishment (补充) ofwater resources.

The rate of damage to the natural environment was found to increase globally, despite concerted efforts to persuade governments to take measures to improve the condition. "If current trends continue, and the world fails to improve patterns of production and consumption, then the state of the world's environment will continue to decline," warned UN executive director Achim Steiner.

He said the tools for improving the environment for millions of people existed in developed countries, but were in danger of not being used.

The study found that basic measures to tackle some of the key causes of environmental damage were still not being taken. These included measures to reduce air pollution, to control the damage to marine eco-systems, which can have a huge effect on fish stocks on which hundreds of millions of people depend;and to curb the degradation of land where modern agricultural methods were pursued without regard to the longer-term consequences.

Despite the recent global agreement on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, global carbon output continues to rise. This will put a long-term strain on the ability of developing economies to feed their own people. Climate change is aggravated by the emissions of greenhouse gases from chemical and natural fertilisers used in agriculture which increased by more than a quarter between 2000 and 2010. Other problem areas identified in the report included glaciers, which provide vital water resources for millions of people, but which are shrinking as the climate warms.

In rich countries, these problems have built up over decades and centuries while economic growth was pursued at the expense of the environment. Subsequent efforts to remedy the environment have met with partial success. But in developing countries, the path of future development has more potential to change, which has encouraged international institutions to devise more sustainable growth pathways that are supposed both to alleviate poverty and preserve the environment.

 



51.What is the major finding of the UN environmental study?

A) Human activity has rendered Mother Earth almost uninhabitable.

B) Humans are doing more damage to the earth than it can cope with.

C) Environmental problems have considerably weakened human prosperity.

D) Environmental damage is more serious in developed countries these days.

 

52.What is said about water scarcity in some of the poorest regions?

A) It is getting so serious that there is little hope of solution.

B) It largely accounts for their slow economic development.

C) It can hardly be relieved if no drastic measures are taken.

D) It is primarily caused by the acceleration of climate change.

 

53.What does Achim Steiner say about the environmental condition?

A) It will deteriorate worldwide.

B) It is attracting global attention.

C) It is being slowly remedied globally.

D) It will shrink the world's population.

 

54.What is the dilemma developing countries face?

A) They cannot modernise farming without causing land degradation.

B) They cannot promote industrialisation without polluting waterways.

C) They cannot boost crop yields without causing greenhouse gas emissions.

D) They cannot catch up with rich countries without sacrificing the environment.

 

55.What should developing countries do in their future development according to the passage?

A) They turn to developed countries for the assistance they need.

B) They remedy environmental damage by slowing economic growth.

C) They avoid damaging interference from international institutions.

D) They improve people's livelihood without harming the environment.

Text 14 Some people in the US have asserted that forgiving student loan debt is one way to stimulate the economy and give assistance to those in need. One government proposition is to eliminate $ 10,000 of debt for 'economically distressed' students. Some in US Congress have gone so far as to suggest forgiving up to $ 50,000 in debt per student borrower, but does forgiving student debt necessarily correlate to helping the economically disadvantaged?

The answer is no. This policy is just giving money away to universities and the most affluent students in attendance. Federal Reserve data reveals that the highest-income 40 percent of households owe approximately 60 percent of outstanding student debt, while the lowest 40 percent owe just under 20 percent. This could be due to a combination of factors: students from high-income households are more likely to go to expensive colleges, less likely to receive financial aid, and more likely to have high incomes post-graduation. Plus, the majority of student debt is held by graduate degree earners, who earn approximately 25 percent more than their undergraduate counterparts. Clearly, giving free reign to banks to forgive student debt is a step in the wrong direction.

Other proposals for broader, long-term student loan plans have some fundamental problems. One idea is to cancel student debt only for undergraduate degrees and for students making less than $ 125,000.

This attempts to address the fact that Congress' previously mentioned student loan forgiveness plan largely helps out the wealthy, but is an adverse incentive for universities to keep raising tuition and for students to choose to major in low-earning degree programs. Colleges have no reason to make their programs more affordable if they believe students will just take out more debt. And, students will feel more comfortable making the irresponsible decision to go tens of thousands of dollars in debt to major in impractical or idealistic subjects if they know their loans will be forgiven.

This is especially concerning given the pandemic (大流行病) has rendered a college education practically worthless. Students are paying tens of thousands of dollars per year to live at home and be lectured on the Internet. Do we really want to tell colleges that they can get away with providing belowaverage service for an outrageous cost?

In the case of any of these student debt plans, working-class Americans who chose not to or could not afford to go to college will be subsidizing the education of the professional class. Plumbers and retail workers will be paying for the degrees of doctors and lawyers.

The US government's effort to help those in debt is commendable but is this really the solution that will help the poor financially recover?

Text 15 If there's one rule that most parents cling to in the confusing, fast-changing world of kids and media, it's "No sereens before age 2."

As of today, that rule has been thrown out the window.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), which first issued that recommendation back in 1999, has extensively updated and revised its guidelines for children and adolescents to reflect new research and new habits.

The new guidelines, especially for very young children, shift the focus from WHAT is on the screen to WHO else is in the room. And in doing so, they raise some intriguing points about the future of learningfrom media.

For babies younger than 18 months, AAP still says no sereens at all are the best idea-with one notable exception: Live video chat. Surveys indicate that families already popularly believe that "Face time doesn't count", or at least that the benefit of virtual visits with grandparents or other relatives outweighs the potential cost of exposing babies to the laptop or smartphone.

The AAP doesn't cite positive evidence that infants actually get something out of this kind of "conversation", the way that they clearly do from live social interaction. But there's some observational research that infants as young as six months old are emotionally engaged by playing live peekaboo (躲猫猫游戏) with Grandma online.

For infants and toddlers (学步儿童), ages 15 months to 2 years old, there's limited evidence from a couple of very small studies that they can learn new words from educational media, if and only if parents are watching alongside them, repeating what the video says and/or drawing attention to what is on the screen. In other words, treating a video or an app like a picture book is the best bet.

The flip side of this is that many studies have actually shown poorer language skills correlated with earlier solo viewing of "educational" videos. There's also research that shows language delays in children who watch more TV and start watching earlier. In both cases, the problem seems to be media replacing interaction with people. For this reason, the new AAP guideline has changed from "avoid all screens under age 2" to "avoid solo media use in this age group.”

For preschoolers ages 2 to 5, there's more evidence that they have the ability to transfer knowledge from screens to the real world, including early literacy and math. For this age group, AAP recommends no more than an hour a day of sereen use. And, just as with younger children, they want care-givers to take part in screen time: "Co-view with your children, help children understand what they are seeing, and help them apply what they learn to the world around them."

 



50.What do we learn about the "No screens under 2" rule?

A) It has met more and more resistance from parents.

B) It has proved helpful to children's healthy growth.

C) It confuses parents with regard to kids' education.

D) It has been discarded in line with recent research.

 

51.What do the new AAP guidelines advocate?

A) Young children should be accompanied by parents during screen time.

B) Parents should be emotionally involved in their children's upbringing.

C) Young children should watch videos carefully selected by parents.

D) Parents should protect their children from too much media exposure.

 

52.What do families think of live video chat according to surveys?

A) It should not be regarded as screen time.

B) It helps babies to develop their verbal skills.

C) It is not as harmful as playing games on laptops.

D) It is a good substitute for video viewing.

 

53.What do researches find about kids solo viewing educational videos?

A) It arouses their interest in language learning.

B) It works no better than reading picture books.

C) It hampers their development of language skills.

D) It helps them acquire independent learning skills.

54.What does the author say about preschoolers ages 2 to 5?

A) They can understand pretty well what they see on the screen.

B) They can learn on their own without much parental guidance.

Text 16 How can one person enjoy good health, while another person looks old before her time? Humans have been asking this question for thousands of years, and recently, it's becoming clearer and clearer to scientists that the differences between people's rates of aging lie in the complex interactions among genes, social relationships, environments and lifestyles. Even though you were born with a particular set of genes, the way you live can influence how they express themselves. Some lifestyle factors may even turn genes on or shut them off.

Deep within the genetic heart of all our cells are telomeres, or repeating segments of noncoding DNA that live at the ends of the chromosomes (染色体). They form caps at the ends of the chromosomes and keep the genetic material together. Shortening with each cell division, they help determine how fast a cell ages. When they become too short, the cell stops dividing altogether. This isn't the only reason a cell can age-there are other stresses on cells we don't yet understand very well-but short telomeres are one of the major reasons human cells grow old. We've devoted most of our careers to studying telomeres, and one extraordinary discovery from our labs is that telomeres can actually lengthen.

Scientists have learned that several thought patterns appear to be unhealthy for telomeres, and one of them is cynical hostility. Cynical hostility is defined by high anger and frequent thoughts that other people cannot be trusted. Someone with hostility doesn't just think, "I hate to stand in long lines"; they think."Others deliberately sped up and beat me to my rightful position in the line!"-and then get violently agitated. People who score high on measures of cynical hostility tend to get more heart disease, metabolic disease and often die at younger ages. They also have shorter telomeres. In a study of British civil servants, men who scored high on measures of cynical hostility had shorter telomeres than men whose hostility scores were low. The most hostile men were 30% more likely to have short telomeres.

What this means: aging is a dynamic process that could possibly be accelerated or slowed-and, in some aspects, even reversed. To an extent, it has surprised us and the rest of the scientific community that telomeres do not simply carry out the commands issued by your genetic code. Your telomeres are listening to you. The foods you eat, your response to challenges, the amount of exercise you get, and many other factors appear to influence your telomeres and can prevent premature aging at the cellular level. One of the keys to enjoying good health is simply doing your part to foster healthy cell renewal.

**From Accountant to Yogi: Making a Radical Career Change**

[A] At some point, almost all of us will experience a period of radical professional change. Some of us will seek it out; for others it will feel like an unwelcome intrusion into otherwise stable careers. Either way, we have choices about how we respond to it when it comes.

 

[B] We recently caught up with yoga entrepreneur Leah Zaccaria, who put herself through the fire of change to completely reinvent herself. In her search to live a life of purpose, Leah left her high-paying accounting job, her husband, and her home, hi the process, she built a radically new life and career. Since then, she has founded two yoga studios, met a new life partner, and formed a new community of people. Even if your personal reinvention is less drastic, we think there are lessons from her experience that apply.

 

[C] Where do the seeds of change come from? the Native American Indians have a saying: “Pay attention to the whispers so you won’t have to hear the screams.” Often the best ideas for big changes come from unexpected places — it’s just a matter of tuning in. Great leaders recognize the weak signals or slight signs that point to big changes to come. Leah reflects on a time she listened to the whispers: “About the time my daughter was five years old. I started having a sense that ‘this isn’t right.”’ She then realized that her life no longer matched her vision for it.

[D] Up until that point, Leah had followed traditional measures of success. After graduating with a degree in business and accounting, she joined a public accounting firm, married, bought a house, put lots of stuff in it, and had a baby. “I did what everybody else thought looked successful,” she says. Leah easily could have fallen into a trap of feeling content; instead, her energy sparked a period of experimentation and renewal.

[E] Feeling the need to change, Leah started playing with future possibilities by exploring her interests and developing new capabilities. First trying physical exercise and dieting, she lost some weight and discovered an inner strength. “1 felt powerful because 1 broke through my own limitations,” she recalls.

 

[F] However, it was another interest that led Leah to radically reinvent herself. “I remember sitting on a bench with my aunt at a yoga studio,’’ she said, having a moment of clarity right then and there: Yoga is saving my life. Yoga is waking me up. I’m not happy and I want to change and I’m done with this.” In that moment of clarity Leah made an important leap,conquering her inner resistance to change and making a firm commitment to take bigger steps.

 

[G] Creating the future you want is a lot easier if you are ready to exploit the opportunities that come your way. When Leah made the commitment to change, she primed herself to new opportunities she may otherwise have overlooked. She recalls:

 

[H] One day a man I worked with, Ryan, who had his office next to mine, said, “Leah, let’s go look at this space on Queen Anne.” He knew my love for yoga and had seen a space close to where he lived that he thought might be good to serve as a yoga studio. As soon as I saw the location, I knew this was it. Of course I was scared, yet I had this strong sense of “I have to do this.” Only a few months later Leah opened her first yoga studio, but success was not instant.

 

[I] Creating the future takes time. That’s why leaders continue to manage the present while building toward the big changes of the future. When it’s time to make the leap, they take action and immediately drop what’s no longer serving their purpose. Initially Leah stayed with her accounting job while starting up the yoga studio to make it all work.

[J] Soon after, she knew she had to make a bold move to fully commit to her new future. Within two years, Leah shed the safety of her accounting job and made the switch complete. Such drastic change is not easy.

 

[K] Steering through change and facing obstacles brings us face to face with our fears. Leah reflects on one incident that triggered her fears, when her investors threatened to shut her down: “I was probably up against the most fear I’ve ever had，” she says. “I had spent two years cultivating this community, and it had become successful very fast, but within six months I was facing the prospect of losing it all.”

 

[L] She connected with her sense of purpose and dug deep, cultivating a tremendous sense of strength. “I was feeling so intentional and strong that I wasn’t going to let fear just take over. I was thinking, ‘OK, guys, if you want to try to shut me down, shut me down.’And I knew it was a negotiation scheme, so I was able to say to myself, ‘This is not real.’” By naming her fears and facing them head-on, Leah gained confidence. For most of us, letting go of the safety and security of the past gives us great fear. Calling out our fears explicitly, as Leah did,can help us act decisively.

 

[M] The cycle of renewal never ends. Leah’s growth spurred her to open her second studio— and it wasn’t for the money.

 

[N] I have no desire to make millions of dollars. It’s not about that; it’s about growth for me. Honestly, I didn’t need to open a second studio. I was making as much money as I was as an accountant. But I know if you don’t grow, you stand still, and that doesn’t work for me.

 

[O] Consider the current moment in your own life, your team or your organization. Where are you in the cycle of renewal: Are you actively preserving the present, or selectively forgetting the past, or boldly creating the future? What advice would Leah give you to move you ahead on your journey? Once we’re on the path of growth, we can continually move through the seasons of transformation and renewal.

 

 

\36. Readiness to take advantage of new opportunities will make it easier to create one’s desired future.

\37. By conventional standards, Leah was a typical successful woman before she changed her career.

\38. Leah gained confidence by laying out her fears and confronting them directly.

\39. In search of a meaningful life, Leah gave up what she had and set up her own yoga studios.

40 Leah's interest in yoga prompted her to make a firm decision to reshape her life.

\41. Small signs may indicate great changes to come and therefore merit attention.

\42. Leah’s first yoga studio was by no means an immediate success.

\43. Some people regard professional change as an unpleasant experience that disturbs their stable careers.

\44. The worst fear Leah ever had was the prospect of losing her yoga business.

\45. As she explored new interests and developed new potentials，Leah felt powerful internally.



 



第一篇长篇 阅读答案：G D L B F C H A K E

第二篇

**Saving Our Planet**

A) In the long view, the human relationship with forests has been one of brutal destruction,but even it carries elements of slow hope. In the Middle Ages, there was no shortage of timber in most parts of the world, and few saw cutting down forests as a problem. Yet in 1548 the people of Venice estimated that an important timber supply would last only 30 years at their current rate of usage-but different forest management would make it possible to meet the demand for many centuries to come. The idea of preserving resources came out of a concern for the future: a fear of using up resources faster than they could be replenished (补充).

B)  

C) Economic interests were at the core of this understanding of trees and forests. It would take more than three centuries before scientists began to understand that timber production is not the only, and possibly not the most important, function of forests. The late 19th and early 20th century saw an increasing recognition that forests serve as habitats for countless animal and plant species that all rely on each other. They take over protective functions against soil erosion and landslides (塌方); they make a significant contribution to the water balance as they prevent surface runoff; they filter dirt particles, greenhouse gases and radioactive substances from the air; they produce oxygen; they provide spaces for recreation and they preserve historic and prehistoric remains. As a result, forests around the world have been set aside as parks or wilderness areas.

 

C) Recent years have seen a big change in our view of forests. Peter Wohlleben's book The Hidden Life of Trees (2015), an international bestseller, suggests that trees can warn each other of danger through a "wood wide web" of roots and fungi (真菌). support each other through sharing of nutrients and information, and they even keep ancient stumps alive by feeding them solutions of sugars. Such insights have made us aware of deep ecological relationships between humans and the more-than-human world.

 

D)Awareness of ecologies is a recent phenomenon. It was not until the 1940s that the concept of the "environment" embracing all living and nonliving things developed. In the 1970s, the term "environment" gained currency, becoming widely adopted in the English and Romance languages, and as "Umwelt" ("surrounding world") in German.The emergence of the idea led to the rise of environmental agencies, regulations and environmental studies, and to environmental science as new, integrated academic disciplines. It was in 1956 that the very first bachelor of science in environmental studies was awarded, at the State University of New York College of Forestry at Syracuse. Since the 1970swith the rise of "environmentalism"-environmental studies programmes have sprung up at hundreds of universities. There is (slow) hope in the fact that scholars from many different disciplines have adopted the term "environment" over the past decades. They are exploring intricate connections within and between complex ecologies, as well as the impact that human environment-making (through techno-industrial, economic and other manipulative developments) has had on the biosphere.

 

E) The rise of the idea of the ervironment and a scholarly understanding of ecological processes has influenced new technologies and also politics. We have come to ask questions about vulnerability and risk, world ecologies, and the relationship be:ween nature and power. The search for an adequate response to climate change occupies centre stage in international diplomacy.

 

A) Social and environmental activists, scientists and indigenous groups have called the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in December 2015 insufficient, weak, or compromised. To some extent, they are right: climate change has already destroyed tens of thousands of livelihoods, and the situation will worsen in the near future for millions of mostly poorer people, who will join the ranks of those who have already been displaced by climate change and extreme weather events. But the Paris Conference nevertheless marked a historic step toward the recognition of the need for action on climate change, the cutting of carbon emissions, and world cooperation.There were 195 nations that cane to the table in Paris and agreed to limits on emissions.Historically, nothing comparable had happened prior to this. Before the 20th century, a handful of scientists had been interested in the theoretical relationship beween greenhouse gases and climate change, but only the empirical evidence accumulated since the late 20th century established a clear connection between the burning of fossil fuels and a vastly accelerated rise in global temperatures.

B)  

C) The current crisis is not the first that humans have encountered, and a look at the struggles with pollution in recent history reveals transformations that once seemed unimaginable. The "London fog" that came to define the capital through British novels and thrillers is in reality smog or smoke, a legacy of industrialisation. After a century of ignorance, London was hit by the Great Smog of December 1952-the worst air-pollution event in the history of the United Kingdom which caused the deaths of approximately 12,000 people. Shortly thereafter, public initiatives and political campaigns led to strict regulations and new laws, including the Clean Air Act (1956).Today, London has effectively reduced traffic emissions through the introduction of a Congestion Charge Zone in 2003, and an Ultra Low Emission Zone in 2019.

 

D) Scientific evidence that we are living in an era of climate change, resource exhaustion and potential ecological disaster is overwhelming. How do we motivate a public exhausted by never-ending scenarios of doom and disaster, when the challenges seem so huge and so impossible to solve? Statistics about extinction and the gloom of decline will not in themselves get us out of our often self-created ecological traps: instead, they are more likely to result in paralysis and inaction.

 

E) We need stories and histories of change and transformation: ecological stories that make us confront the fact that human power is potentially destructive, and that the survival of our species on this planet depends on the preservation of soil and water, and the habitats and ecological systems.

F) It is time that we showed successes and accelerations in ecological awareness, action and restoration: stories that include past successes and future visions about the rise of urban gardening and of renaturalised riverscapes, of successful protests against polluted air and water, of the rise of regional markets and slow food, and the planting of trees around the globe, of initiatives and enterprises that work towards ecological restoration.The reality of ecological curses seems far greater than the power of the hopes left at the bottom of Pandora's box. But if we believe that nothing can be changed, then we are giving up our opportunity to ad.

 

K) Today's saving powers will not come from a deus ex machina (解围之神). In an ever-more complex and synthetic world, our saving powers won't come from a single source, and certainly not from a too-big-to-fail approach or from those who have been drawn into the whirlpool of our age of speed. Hope can work as a wake up call. It acknowledges setbacks. The concept of slow hope suggests that we can't expect things to change overnight. If the ever-faster exhaustion of natural resources (in ecological terms) and the "shrinking of the present" (in social terms) are urgent problems of humans, then cutting down on exhaustive practices and working towards a "stretching of the present" will be ways to move forward.

36.Climate change has wrought havoc on the lives of tens of thousands of people.

 

37.It took scientists a long time to realise that the function of forests goes far beyond providing humans with timber.

 

38.There is abundant evidence that we are now facing a possible ecological disaster.

 

39.Environmental science became academic disciplines only some sixty years ago.

 

40.Things cannot change overnight, but reducing the consumption of natural resources will help solve the ecological crisis.

 

41.Human perception of forests has undergone a tremendous change in the past years

 

42.Recent history shows reduction of pollution, once seemingly impossible, can actually be accomplished.

 

43.People began to consider preserving natural resources when they feared they would have nothing to use in the future

 

44.If we doubt our ability to reverse ecological deterioration, we are throwing away the chance to take action.

 

\45. How to respond effectively to climate change has become the focus of international diplomacy.

**The Doctor Will Skype You Now**

A)Fazila is a young woman that has been dealing with eczema (湿疹), a common skin condition, for the past five years, but never got it treated. The nearest hospital is an hour away, by boat and bus, and her skin condition didn't seem serious enough to make the trek, so she ignored it—until a new technology brought the doctor to her. Fazila lives on one of the remote river islands in northern Bangladesh. These islands are low-lying.temporary sand islands that are continuously formed and destroyed through sand buildup and erosion. They are home to over six million people, who face repeated displacement from flooding and erosion—which may be getting worse because of climate change-and a range of health risks, including poor nutrition, malaria (疟疾) and other water-borne diseases.

 

B)The most dangerous thing for these remote island dwellers is land erosion. The second is lack of access to medical supplies and doctors. There are no doctors within miles, and while child mortality and maternal death have gone down in the rest of the country, this is not the case for the islands. The medical situation is so bad that it really takes away from the quality of their life. Yet for many island inhabitants-some of Bangladesh's poorest-paying for health care is a costly ordeal. Victims of erosion lose their houses, agricultural land and jobs as farmers, fishermen and day laborers. Though government hospitals are free, many people hesitate to go, citing long commutes, endless lines and questionable diagnoses. For convenience's sake, one-third of rural households visit.unqualified village doctors, who rely on unscientific methods of treatment, according to a 2016 study in the peer-reviewed journal Global Health Action.

 

C) On the islands, there's even a colloquial (口头的) expression for the idea of making medical care your lowest priority: It's known as "rog pushai rakha" in Bengali, which roughly translates to "stockpiling their diseases"—waiting to seek medical attention until a condition becomes extremely serious. Now, a new virtual medical service called Teledaktar (TD) is trying to make health care more easily accessible. Every week, TD's medical operators travel to the islands by boat, carrying a laptop, a portable printer for prescriptions and tools to run basic medical screenings such as blood pressure, blood sugar, body temperature and weight. They choose an area of the island with the best Internet reception and set up a makeshift (临时凑合的) medical center which consists of plastic stools and small tables borrowed from the locals' homes, a tent in case of rain and a sheet that is strung up to give the patients privacy during their session.

 

D)Launched in October 2018, TD has eight centers in towns and villages across rural Bangladesh and on three islands. It is funded by a nonprofit organization founded by Bangladeshi entrepreneurs, finance and technology professionals. Inside the center, the laptop screen lights up to reveal Dr. Tina Mustahid, TD's head physician, live-streamed (网络直播) from the capital city of Dhaka for free remote medical consultations.Affectionately called Doctor Apa—"older sister" in Bengali—by her patients, she is one of three volunteer doctors at TD.

 

E)"I diagnose them through conversation," says Dr. Mustahid. "Sometimes it's really obvious things that local doctors don't have the patience to talk through with their patients. For example, a common complaint mothers come in with is that their children refuse to eat their meals. The mothers are concerned they are dealing with indigestion,but it's because they are feeding the children packaged chips which are cheap and convenient. I tell them it is ruining their appetite and ask them to cut back on unhealthy snacks." Dr. Mustahid says building awareness about health and nutrition is important for island patients who are cut off from mainland resources.

 

F) Even off the islands, Bangladesh faces a critical deficit of health services. The country has half the doctors-per-person ratio recommended by the World Health Organization: roughly one doctor per 2,000 people, instead of one doctor per 1,000 people. And of those physicians, many are concentrated in cities: 70% of the country's population live in rural areas, yet less than 20% of health workers practice there. Over 70% of TD's 3,000 patients are female, in part because many are not comfortable speaking with local doctors who tend to be male. The rural women are mostly not literate or confident enough to travel on their own to the nearest town to visit medical facilities. Many have spent their entire lives rebuilding their homes when the islands flood. Early marriage and young motherhood, which are prevalent in these parts of Bangladesh, also contribute to the early onset of health problems.

 

G)For most TD patients on the islands, Dr. Mustahid is the first big-city doctor that they've ever consulted. TD doctors are not meant to treat serious illnesses or conditions that require a doctor to be physically present, such as pregnancy. But they can write prescriptions, diagnose common ailments—including digestive issues, joint pain, skin diseases, fever and the common cold-and refer patients to doctors at local hospitals.The visit is also an opportunity for the patients, especially women, to air their concerns about aging, motherhood and reproductive health according to Dr. Mustahid The doctors also offer health, dietary and lifestyle advice where necessary, including insight on everything from recognizing postnatal (产后的) depression to daily exercise. Dr.Mustahid regularly recommends her patients to take a daily thirty-minute morning walk before the sun gets too intense.

 

H) After a few sessions about general health issues Fazila finally opened up about something else that was bothering her: her persistent skin condition. It can get expensive to travel to the doctor, so usually the women living on the islands describe their illness to their husbands. The husbands then go to the pharmacy, try to describe the issue and return home with some random medicines. Nothing worked for Fazila until she started seeing Dr. Apa.

 

I)Other nonprofits are also starting to provide health services on the islands. A local non-governmental organization called Friendship operates floating boat hospitals that provide health services to islands all over Bangladesh, docking at each for two months at a time. Friendship also runs satellite clinics in which one doctor and one clinic aide who are residents of the community disperse health and hygiene information.

 

J)TD still has a few major challenges. Many residents complain the medicines they are prescribed are sometimes unaffordable, but the government isn't doing enough for them.Patients often ask why the medicine isn't free along with the consultation from the doctors. The organizations are linked to local pharmacies and offer discounts to the patients and make sure to prescribe the most cost-effective brands, but still many residents can't afford even that.

 

K) Nevertheless, TD's remote consultations seem to be popular: Of 3,000 patients, a: least 200 have returned for follow-ups, according to TD. The reason, explains one resident, might be the simple gesture of treating the island inhabitants with respect. "Dr. Apa is patient," he says, "At government hospitals, the doctors treat us very badly, but here they listen to us, I can repeat myself many times and no one gets annoyed."



 

36.Some children on the remote islands won't eat their meals because they are fed cheap junk food.

 

37.Unlike other parts of Bangladesh, the number of women who die from giving birth remains high on the river islands.

 

38, One big problem many islanders have is that they can't afford the prescribed medicines, even with discounts offered.

 

39.TD is a virtual medical service financially supported by one of the nation's nonprofit organizations.

 

40.TD doctors are welcome to the islanders because they treat the sick with respect and patience.

 

41.Women islanders tend to have health problems early partly because they get married and give birth early.

 

42.TD doctors make weekly visits to the remote islands to provide services at a temporary medical center.

 

43.TD doctors provide the islanders with online diagnoses and treatments for common diseases.

 

44.The residents of the river islands have to keep moving their homes because of floods and land erosions.

 

\45. Women islanders usually rely on their husbands to get some medicines for them without diagnoses and prescriptions.

It is important that scientists be seen as normal people asking and answering important questions. Good, sound science depends on  26 , experiments and reasoned methodologies. It requires a willingness to ask new questions and try new approaches. It requires one to take risks and experience failures. But good science also requires  27  understanding, clear explanation and concise presentation.

Our country needs more scientists who are willing to step out in the public  28  and offer their opinions on important matters. We need more scientists who can explain what they are doing in language that is  29 and understandable to the public. Those of us who are not scientists should also be prepared to support public engagement by scientists, and to 30  scientific knowledge into our public communications.

Too many people in this country, including some among our elected leadership, still do not understand how science works or why robust, long-range investments in research vitally matter. In the 1960s, the United States 31  nearly 17% of discretionary (可酌情支配的) spending to research and development, 32  decades of economic growth. By 2008, the figure had fallen into the single  33   This occurs at a time when other nations have made significant gains in their own research capabilities.

At the University of California (UC), we 34  ourselves not only on the quality of our research, but also on its contribution to improving our world. To 35 the development of science from the lab bench to the market place, UC is investing our own money in our own good ideas.
